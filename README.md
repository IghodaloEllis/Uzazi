# THE INTRODUCTION
We're currently working with AI on this project, but we're also welcoming contributions from others. 
We may not end up using every library and framework listed, but we're keeping our options open for input from contributors.
Don't worry if no **JUJU** we'll NOT sleep on this one cause we Love💟 it. Working with AI is not as easy as you think because you have to know what to tell AI to do.



## AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform
### Problem
Traditional education systems often struggle to cater to the diverse learning styles and paces of individual students.
